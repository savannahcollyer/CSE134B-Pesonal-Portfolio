        <p> I have multiple hobbies including cooking, reading, puzzling, and hiking!</p>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p> I try to read about 4 books a month. This means that I have read MANY books in my life. However, my <strong>absolute favorite book</strong> is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Patient-Alex-Michaelides/dp/1250301696">The Silent Patient.</a> </p>
        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>Another hobby I have is cooking! I try to cook at least 2 new recipes a week. Here are some of my favorite recipes!</p>
        <h2>Puzzling</h2>
        <p>Since quarantine started, I have completed many puzzles in my time at home.</p>
        <template>This is hidden content but soon I will show a picture of my favorite puzzle that I've done!</template>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Click on the play button to play my favorite song:</p>
